# Design Decisions

Technical choices made during development of this project, with
rationale. Future-Jamie and future-Claude both read this file when
investigating "why is it this way?"

`/wind-down` proposes additions to this file when a session made a
real design decision (not every session does). `/onboard` writes the
first entry recording the choices made during onboarding.

## When to record a decision here

A decision belongs in this file when:
- A future engineer (including future-Claude) might wonder "why is it
  this way?" or "why didn't we do X?"
- Multiple options were considered and the choice has consequences
  beyond a single line of code.
- A constraint or tradeoff drove the choice (performance, platform,
  cost, time-to-market) that won't be obvious from the code.

A decision does NOT belong here when:
- It's a trivial implementation choice (variable name, file location,
  helper function shape).
- It's already obvious from the architecture doc or the requirements.
- The "why" is "the framework requires it."

## Format

Each entry uses the same shape so the file scans cleanly. Pattern
borrowed from `ds-auto-dailies/docs/design-decisions.md`.

```
## <Decision title — what was decided, in one phrase>

**Decision.** What we chose, in one or two sentences.

**Why.** What drove the choice — the constraint, tradeoff, or insight
that made this the right answer.

**Why not <alternative 1>.** Why the obvious alternative didn't win.
Concrete; cite specifics, not general preferences.

**Why not <alternative 2>.** ... (only if there were genuine
alternatives)

**Scope note** (optional). Any boundary on when this decision applies
or what could re-open it.
```

<!-- Onboarding will add the first decision here. Subsequent decisions
go below it in chronological order. The most-recent decision is at
the bottom. -->
