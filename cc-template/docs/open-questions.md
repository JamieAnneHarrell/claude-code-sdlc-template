# Open Questions and Engineering Notes

Working surface for unresolved questions, deferred decisions,
abandoned approaches, and things worth revisiting. Update as answers
are found or decisions are made.

`/wind-down` proposes additions to this file at session end. `/onboard`
seeds it with any open questions that the design intake left
unresolved.

## How this file relates to other tracking

- **`TODO.txt`** — questions that *must* be resolved at the start of
  the next session belong there, not here. This file is for genuinely
  open / non-blocking items.
- **`design-decisions.md`** — once a question gets answered with a
  real decision, it moves there.
- **`PROJECT_PLAN.md`** — when an open question becomes scoped work,
  it becomes a phase or a phase deliverable.

## Categories

Use these section headers. Add a category section only when there's a
real entry to put under it; don't pre-create empty sections.

### Deferred User Stories
Things we've thought about and decided not to build yet. Format:
*Context* (what / why), *Proposed approach*, *Open sub-questions*.
Lift the name into PROJECT_PLAN.md when it's time to build.

### Known Limitations
Things the current implementation does NOT handle gracefully, with
the conditions that trigger the limitation and a mitigation if there
is one. Document so future debugging starts here.

### Abandoned Approaches
Things we tried, why they failed, and what replaced them. Useful when
someone (Claude or human) tries the same thing again — the file
reminds them why it didn't work.

### Open Questions
Questions we haven't yet answered, with what we know so far and what
would unblock an answer.

<!-- Add entries below in their category sections. The example
sections above are guides; the file should only contain real entries
once onboarding has run. -->
